// This method opens the file "pokedex.json" and reads the data as binary data (NSData) first.
// In the "do" block, it converts the raw binary data into a JSON array object. A JSON object is
// of type "Any", so an array of "Any" is returned ("[Any]"). If there is an error in the parsing,
// the error is recognized in the "catch" block, and the error message is printed out.
// Note: see pokedex.json to see what JSON syntax looks like. JSON is just a way to represent something
// in plain text data.
